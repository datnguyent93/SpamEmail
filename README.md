## Project Plan

A framework to learn and finish the Spam Email machine learning project.

### Theory Background

Machine learning includes linear regression algorithms. This is also known as the line of best fit.

The general formula for a linear model is: outputs = biases + weights(inputs)

#### Supervised Learning

To predict the label of the instances based on learned relationship.

Examples:

* Spam Email Detection

    * Mark email as "spam" or "not spam"

    * [Spam Mail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset)

* Sentiment Analysis

    * Review Twitter posts -> classify: positive, negative, neutral

    * [Sentiment Analyser Blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-ways-to-develop-a-sentiment-analyser-in-machine-learning-e8352872118 "Libraries of sentiment analyser")
    
    * [Hugging Face Blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-python "Getting started with sentiment analysis using Python")

#### Unsupervised Learning

To discover the underlying structure in the data.

Examples:

* Book classification

* Customer segmentation

#### Reinforcement Learning

To make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize rewards.

Examples:

* Minesweeper Bot

* Racing car on a race track

#### Neural Network Learning (Deep Learning)

To adapt to changing input. Can be supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised.

Examples:

* Image recognition

* Text generation
