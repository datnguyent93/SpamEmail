# Notes

These are notes for Tan Nguyen and Alex Akoopie.

## Project Plan

Tan Nguyen and Alex Akoopie are trying to do something with machine learning.

Machine learning includes linear regression (line of best fit) -> outputs = biases + weights(inputs)

### Theory Background
- reenforcement learning
- linear regression
- image classification

1. supervised learning: to predict the label of the instances based on learned relationship
    - email spam detection: "spam" or "not spam"
        * [Spam Mail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset)
    - sentiment analysis: review tweet -> classify: positive, negative, neutral
        * [Sentiment Analyser Blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-ways-to-develop-a-sentiment-analyser-in-machine-learning-e8352872118 "Libraries of sentiment analyser")
        * [Hugging Face Blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-python "Getting Started with sentiment analysis using Python")
2. unsupervised learning: to discover the underlying structure in the data
    - customer segmentation, books classification
    - association - discovering relations btw variables: market basket analysis
    - 
3. reenforcement learning: make decisions by performing actions in an envir to maximize rewards
    - chess game bot, minesweeper
4. neural network learning (Deep learning): can be supervised, unsup, or semi-sup. can adapt to changing input
    - image recognition
    - text generation

### How to learn:
- use of tutorials
- ChatGPT
- online courses

### What to learn:
- Machine learning process: thought process, models
    * [Machine Learning Process](https://www.codecademy.com/article/the-ml-process "The Machine learning Process")
- Using available ML models
